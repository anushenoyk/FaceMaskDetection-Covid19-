# FaceMaskDetection-Covid19-
Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning
During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 
Their use is intended as personal protection to prevent infection and as source control to limit transmission of the virus in a community or healthcare setting.
The use of face masks or coverings by the general public has been recommended by health officials to minimize the risk of transmissions, with authorities either requiring their use in certain settings, such as on public transport and in shops, or universally in public.
